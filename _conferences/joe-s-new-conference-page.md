                  <p>THE&nbsp;BEAM</p>

                  <p>Learn from the leading experts and Erlang committers about new language constructs, VM
                                          implementations, and powerful libraries which form the Erlang eco-system. You will learn how many of
                                          its features work and how to best use them to write fast and efficient code.</p>

              <div class="col m-col-12">
                  <p>SCALABILITY AND RELIABILITY</p>

                  <p>Scaling&nbsp;has been a given for many years now and the BEAM supervision concepts are well
                                          understood. But you need more, much more. You want to build distributed clusters of massive
                                          potential, you want to monitor your systems and automatically provision replacement hardware in case
                                          of failures. What is best-practice? What are the big players doing? How do you ensure you don&#39;t
                                          have to wake in the middle of the night?</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col m-col-12">
                  <p>TOOLS</p>

                  <p>It&#39;s not always clear what off-the-shelf software is useful in production-quality systems. In the
                                          tools&nbsp;track, you will learn what existing production systems&#39; maintainers are using to
                                          monitor and test their systems via war stories and experience reports of novice and expert users.
                  </p>

                  <p>FRAMEWORKS</p>

                  <p>In the frameworks track, you will learn from the leading experts and committers about new and leading
                                          frameworks such as&nbsp; Phoenix, MongooseIM, Nerves and RabbitMQ. You will find out how these
                                          frameworks work, how to best use them and where not to use them.</p>

                  <p>WEB &amp; APIS</p>

                  <p>With recent innovations the BEAM is now suitable for rapid web application development and gives any
                                          of the established frameworks a run for their money. Much work has been done to integrate with cloud
                                          providers such as Google and Amazon, and containerisation such as Docker and Kubernetes. The BEAM of
                                          2019 can control your infrastructure, write Google documents, and is ideal for integrating with 3rd
                                          party services such as machine learning, and payment providers.</p>

                  <p>CASE STUDIES</p>

                  <p>Every new domain that Erlang and Elixir push into brings a new class of problems and a new class of
                                          solutions. In this track, we&#39;ll learn from other&#39;s experience, where things have been peachy
                                          and where they haven&#39;t been so much. We&#39;ll all walk away with a more clear idea of how to
                                          build highly reliable software.</p>

                  <p>INTRODUCTION TO ERLANG AND ELIXIR</p>

                  <p>New to Erlang and/or Elixir? Interested, but don&#39;t know quite where to dig in? We&#39;ve all been
                                          there! In this track, you will learn from other&#39;s experience, get a sense of the lay of the
                                          software ecosystem, get help from the community and contribute back for everyone&#39;s benefit.</p>
